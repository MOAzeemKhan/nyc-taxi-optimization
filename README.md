# NYC Taxi Transportation Optimization

This project presents an optimization strategy for New York City taxis by considering historical data. The aim of the strategy is to increase the earnings of taxi drivers by allocating taxis depending on location and time so more passengers can be transported.

## Getting Started

git clone 
```

## Dataset Details

The dataset used in this project is the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) Trip Record Data. The dataset provides information on taxi trips in New York City, including pickup and dropoff locations, trip distance, fare amount, and more. The data is available on the TLC website: https://www.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page

## Flask Functionality

This project includes a Flask web application that allows users to upload their own CSV files of demand and cost matrix data. The web application uses the uploaded data to generate an optimized allocation of taxis based on the historical data.

To run the web application:

    1) Install the required packages listed in requirements.txt
    2) Run python app.py to start the Flask application
    3) Navigate to http://localhost:5000/ in a web browser to use the application
